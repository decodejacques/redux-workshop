In this exercise set you will integrate redux into a react project. 

# Installation
`npm install`

`npm start`

# Question 1
This react app currently does not do anything. Integrate react redux. Use the reference sheet if you need help [reference sheet](/reference/README.md). You can also go back to the solution video of the first exercise.

# Question 2
Add a checkbox to toggle the boldness of the text.

# Question 3
Add a button to change the text on the left hand side to a randomly generated string.

### Hint

- [Generating random strings](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=generate+random+string+javascript)
- The string on the left hand side will go into the state
- You will need to add something to the parameter of the connect in [Preview.js](./Preview.js).
